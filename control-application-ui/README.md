## Build Setup

First, make sure you've run `yarn install` from the project's root folder to install all workspaces.

``` bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
yarn dev

# build for production with minification
yarn build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
